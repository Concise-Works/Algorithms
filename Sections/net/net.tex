From image segmentation to project selection, these methods reduce complex systems into manageable frameworks, showcasing their broad real-world impact.
\section{Residual Graphs}

\begin{Def}[Flow Network]

    A graph $G=(V,E)$ of $V$ vertices and $E$ edges, carrying a flow of data such that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There is a source node $s$ where data enters the stream.
        \item There is a sink node $t$ where data exits the stream.
        \item Each edge $(u,v)$ has capacity $c(u,v)$, the maximum flow that can pass through it.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Def}

\begin{Def}[Source-Sink Cut (s-t cut)]

    A partition of a flow graph into two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $s \in A$ and $t \in B$. Namely, $B:= \overline{A}$.

\end{Def}

\begin{Def}[Capacity]

    The capacity of a cut $C(A,B)$ is the sum of the edge capacities leaving $A$ to $B$, i.e.,
    \begin{equation}
        C(A,B) := \sum_{u \in A, v \in B} c(u,v)
    \end{equation}
\end{Def}

\newpage
\noindent
Below shows a flow network with source $s$ and sink $t$ nodes, with a capacity cut drawn around nodes $s$ and $b$.

\begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Sections/net/cap.png}
        \caption{Flow Network with Capacity Cut $A$}
    \end{figure}

\noindent
Here the sum of the edge weights leaving $A$ is $c(s,a) + c(b,t) = 20 + 20 = 40$.

\begin{Def}[Minimum Cut (Min Cut)]

    A cut $C(A,B)$ such that the capacity obtained is the minimum possible value for all cuts in the graph.
\end{Def}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Sections/net/min.png}
    \caption{Flow Network with Minimum Cut}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Where the minimum cut is $C(A,B) = 20$, as $c(s,a) + c(s,b) = 10 + 20 = 30$. Note, despite
this cut being around the source node, not all minimum cuts result in this manner.

\newpage

\begin{Def}[Graph Flow]

    For edges $(u,v)$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$, the flow $f(u,v)$ denotes the amount of data flowing from $u$ to $v$.
    For a valid \textbf{s-t flow}, $f$ in $G$ follows the following constraints:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [(i)] Capacity constraint: for all $(u,v)\in G$, $0 \leq f(u,v) \leq c(u,v)$ 
        \item  [(ii)] Flow conservation: for all $v \in V \setminus \{s,t\}$, ${\displaystyle \sum_{u\to v \in V} f(u,v) = \sum_{v\to w \in V} f(v,w)}$
    \end{enumerate}

    \noindent
    I.e., (i) data flows within capacity limits, and (ii) data isn't created or destroyed in the network.
\end{Def}

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{Sections/net/flow.png}
    \caption{Flow Network with Flow a valid flow $f$, as what comes in, is what comes out.}
\end{figure}
\begin{Def}[Maximum Flow (Max Flow)]

    The maximum flow in a network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent from the source to the sink.
    \textbf{Integral Flow,} is a flow where all edge flows are whole integers.
\end{Def}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{Sections/net/max.png}
    \caption{Flow Network with Maximum Flow}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\begin{Def}[Flow Value Lemma]

    For any flow $f$ the value $V(f)$ and any s-t cut $C(A,B)$, the net-flow sent across the cut is equal to the flow leaving $s$, i.e.,
    for $u \in A$ and $v \in B$:
    \begin{equation}
        V(f) = \sum_{\{u\to v\}} f(u,v) - \hspace{-1em} \sum_{\{u\leftarrow v\}} f(v,u)
    \end{equation}
    Subtracting flows entering preserves conservation, as what comes in, is sent out.
\end{Def}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{Sections/net/flowval.png}
    \caption{An s-t cut with net-flow equaling $V(f)$: $(20+20)-(10) = 30 = V(f)$.}
\end{figure}

\begin{Def}[Weak Duality]

    For any flow $f$ and any s-t cut $C(A,B)$, the value of the flow is at most the capacity of the cut, i.e.,
    \begin{equation}
        V(f) \leq C(A,B)
    \end{equation}
\end{Def}

\begin{Def}[Max Flow-Min Cut Theorem]

    By weak duality, \underline{if $V(f)=C(A,B)$ then $f$ is the max-flow and $C(A,B)$ the min-cut.} As by 
    conservation, $V(f)$ cannot get any larger. If $C(A,B)$ weren't the min cut,
    $V(f)<C(A,B)$ bottle-necked by some other smaller capacity.
\end{Def}

\noindent
One could approach this problem iteratively by \textbf{augmenting} the graph by picking the largest path and 
bottle-necking the flow via the lowest capacity edge.\\

\noindent
Though the biggest problem with this approach is that, how do we consider all possible paths? We
could use recursion finding. However, this could lead to an inefficiencies or even infinite loops.

\newpage
\noindent
When filling out our graph, we may want to keep track of what choices we made, and how much flow we have left to give.
For this we introduce the following data structure:
\begin{Def}[Residual Graph]

    Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with flow $f$, we denote its residual graph $G_f = (V,E_f)$, where $E_f$ are a new set of edges generated from augmentations.
    Between two nodes $u$ and $v$ in $G_f$, we have the following edges:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Flow spent from $u$ to $v$, $f(u,v)$, is shown as a \textbf{backward edge} $c_b$ of that capacity, $$c_b(u,v):= f(u,v)$$.
        
        \vspace{-2em}
        \item Flow left to spend is shown as a \textbf{forward edge} $c_f$ with capacity of what's left, $$c_f(u,v) := c(u,v) - f(u,v)$$
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{-1em}
\end{Def}

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{Sections/net/res.png}
    \caption{A graph $G$ and its residual graph $G_f$.}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Our residual graph tells us, going from $s$ to $t$, what paths we can take, and how much flow we have left to spend.
We harness this into the following algorithm:
\begin{theo}[Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm (FFA)]

    Given a flow network $G=(V,E)$, with source $s$ and sink $t$, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm finds the max flow by iteratively augmenting the graph.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Initialize flow $f(u,v) = 0$ for all $(u,v) \in E$.
        \item While there exists a path $p$ from $s$ to $t$ in $G_f$, augment the flow along $p$.
        \item Return the flow $f$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \noindent
    Notably, if a backward edge $c_b(u,v)$ is taken from $s\to t$, then $f(u,v)\in G$ is decreased by $c_b(u,v)$.
    Additionally, each output is an integral flow.
\end{theo}
\newpage 

\noindent
In essence, each round we find a path from $s\to t$ in $G_f$, take that path and update both tables $G$ and $G_f$ with the new flow. Do 
so until we no longer can reach $t$ from $s$ in $G_f$.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{Sections/net/ff.png}
    \caption{Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm in action, terminating at 3 where $s\to t$ is blocked.}
\end{figure}

\begin{theo}[Ford-Fulkerson Max flow-Min Cut Consequence]

    At termination, max flow is obtained. Moreover, nodes from $s$ to blocked nodes $b$ form a cut $C(A,B)$, which is the min cut.
\end{theo}

\section{Bipartite Matching}
In this section we revisit matching problems alike what we saw with Gale-Shapely, Section (\ref{sec:stable-match}). Here we find
the maximum number of matches between two sets of elements, $L$ and $R$, where each element from both sets may partially match some 
set of elements from the other.
\begin{Def}[Bipartite Graph]

    Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, such that $V:=L\cup R$, where $E$ connects nodes $L$ to $R$,
    a cut which separates $V$ into the two sets $L$ and $R$ is called a \textbf{Bipartition}. 
\end{Def}

\noindent
Think, if we had water flowing from $L$ to $R$, what maximum-flow would arise, how many networks could we utilize?

\noindent
\begin{theo}[Max-Matching \& Max-Flow]

    Given a bipartite graph $G=(L\cup R,E)$ with a source and sink from $L\to R$, the flow which runs through nodes $L\to R$ is the maximum matching, each edge a capacity of 1.  
\end{theo}

    they may share nodes.
